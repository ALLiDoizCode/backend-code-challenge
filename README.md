# Notes

Please complete this challenge using Node.js and focus on the problem itself (rather than framework/scaffolding). Please make sure it's reasonably easy to run your code and there are clear instructions for doing so.

You will need to use an external geocoding service. However please implement the distance calculation in your own code. To the extent you need any algorithms, I'm not expecting you to invent anything from scratch, so use Google & external libraries judiciously, and cite/document appropriately.

You can add polish or extra features if you'd like, but remember that software is about tradeoffs and *by far the most important thing is delivering working, practical software that solves the problem of finding the closest store location*. The goal is not to take up a bunch of your time, but see you solve a problem that looks very much like the type of work we do all the time.

There are a ton of different ways to skin this cat -- be smart, be practical, thanks, and good luck!
